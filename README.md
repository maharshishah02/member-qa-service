#📘 Member QA Service

A lightweight FastAPI application that answers natural-language questions using member messages retrieved from the provided public API.

👉 Live Deployment:
```
https://maharshi02-member-qa-service.hf.space/chat/
```
✨ Goal

The service answers natural language questions such as:

“When is Layla planning her trip to London?”

“How many cars does Vikram Desai have?”

“What are Amira’s favorite restaurants?”

Given a question, the API returns:
```
{ "answer": "..." }
```
🚀 Features

✅ FastAPI endpoint /ask

Accepts a question via query parameter and returns the inferred answer.

✅ Gradio UI (/chat)

Interactive chat interface for natural-language Q&A.

✅ Data Source Integration

Reads all member messages from:

```GET https://november7-730026606190.europe-west1.run.app/messages```

✅ Public Deployment

Docker-based FastAPI Space deployed on Hugging Face.

🔧 Tech Stack

FastAPI – backend API

Gradio – chat interface

OpenAI model – reasoning engine

httpx / requests – data fetching

Docker – deployment on Hugging Face

🧪 How It Works

Downloads all messages from the /messages API

Normalizes & indexes the messages

Performs semantic retrieval to find relevant messages

Sends question + retrieved context to an LLM

Returns:

```{ "answer": "..." }```

⭐ Bonus 1: Design Notes (Alternative Approaches)

1) Rule-Based Parsing

Keyword mapping to message fields.

❌ Too brittle for free-form natural language.

2) Embedding-Based Semantic Retrieval (Chosen Approach)

Retrieve relevant messages using vector search.

✔️ Generalizable

✔️ Simple

✔️ Works with varied phrasing

3) Fine-Tuned QA Model

Domain-specific training.

❌ Too heavy for assignment scope.

⭐ Bonus 2: Data Insights

From analyzing the member message dataset:

1) Inconsistent date formats

“next June”, “6/10/2024”, “June 2024”
→ Requires LLM interpretation.

2) Ambiguous references

“her trip”, “my car”
→ Needs context-based disambiguation.

3) Missing information

Some messages imply details but never state them explicitly.

4) Name variations

“Vikram”, “Vik”
→ Must reference same member.

These inconsistencies justify using semantic retrieval + LLM reasoning instead of rule-based parsing.
